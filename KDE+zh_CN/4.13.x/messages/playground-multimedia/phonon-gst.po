"<p>PulseAudio is a sound server for POSIX and Win32 systems. A sound server "
"is basically a proxy for your sound applications. It allows you to do "
"advanced operations on your sound data as it passes between your application "
"and your hardware. Things like transferring the audio to a different "
"machine, changing the sample format or channel count and mixing several "
"sounds into one are easily achieved using a sound server.</p>"
